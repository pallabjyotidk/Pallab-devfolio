Just change `src/portfolio.js` to get your personal portfolio. Customize portfolio theme by using your own color scheme globally in the  `src/_globalColor.scss` file. Feel free to use it as-is or personalize it as much as you want.

If you'd like to **contribute** and make this much better for other users, have a look at [Issues](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio/issues).

Created something awesome for your fork of the portfolio and want to share it? Feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio/pulls).
